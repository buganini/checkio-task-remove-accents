<p>Assuming you are developing a user based system like facebook, you will want to provide the functionality to search for other members regardless of the presence of accents in a username. Without using 3rd party collation library, you will need to remove the accents from username before comparison.</p>

<p>é - letter with accent; e - letter without accent; ̀ and ́ - stand alone accents;</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong> A phrase as a string (unicode)
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output:</strong> An accent free Unicode string.
</p>



<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
checkio(u"préfèrent") == u"preferent"
checkio(u"loài trăn lớn") == u"loai tran lon"
    </pre>
</div>
